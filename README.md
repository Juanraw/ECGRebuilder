# ❤️ ECG and Respiration Signal Reconstruction

Welcome to this repository, where we explore the reconstruction and analysis of **biomedical signals**, specifically **ECG** (electrocardiogram) and **respiration**, using **Python** and a variety of advanced signal processing models. 🚀

## 🔬 Project Goal
The main objective of this project is to provide a set of tools and algorithms capable of **reconstructing missing or corrupted signal segments**, enabling more accurate physiological data analysis. This work is conducted in collaboration with **Dr. Samuel Pimienta**, a medical researcher and PhD candidate, ensuring a rigorous scientific and clinical approach. 🩺

## 🧩 Models and Techniques Used
We implemented multiple methods to tackle signal reconstruction, including:

- **📈 Polynomial Interpolation**: For smooth curve fitting between known data points.  
- **⏱ ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: For time-series modeling and prediction of ECG and respiration signals.  
- **🔊 Fourier Transform**: To analyze and reconstruct signals in the frequency domain.  
- **🧠 MLPRegressor (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: For predicting signal values using machine learning.  
- **🎲 Monte Carlo and Probabilistic Methods**: For robust estimation and handling uncertainty in the data.  

## 📂 Attached Data
This repository includes **data files** containing:

- ECG signals 
- Respiration signals

These datasets allow you to test the algorithms, reproduce results, and experiment with new reconstruction and analysis techniques.

## 📊 Results
The outcomes of the **Polynomial, ARIMA, Fourier, and MLPRegressor** methods are presented in an **attached document**, which contains:

- Comparisons between different methods  
- Graphs and performance metrics  
- Insights into the accuracy and applicability of each technique  

This makes it easy to evaluate which method is best suited depending on the type of signal and data quality.

## ⚙️ Code
The code is fully written in **Python**, structured for easy execution and adaptation. It is designed to:

- Load ECG and respiration datasets  
- Apply the different reconstruction models  
- Save results and comparison graphs automatically
